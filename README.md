# contact-test

This is a contact list made with PHP for a Internish challenge

## How to run this?

1. Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/), if you don't have one of then yet;

2. Clone my project to a local folder;

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/rflpazini/contact-test.git
  ```
  
3. Create a new date base called `contacts_db` and import the `db.sql` to it;

4. Put all files of this repository into `htdocs`;

5. Have fun ;D

Ps.: To login into the app, use this credentials: email-> `admin@admin.com` password -> `123`. In next commit I'll create a page to add new users to the platform. If you want to add a new one, just add it directly to db.
